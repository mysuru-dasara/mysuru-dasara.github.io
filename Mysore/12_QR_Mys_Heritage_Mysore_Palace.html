<section class="mbr-section article mbr-section__container" id="content2-0" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); padding-top: 20px; padding-bottom: 20px;">

    <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-xs-12 lead"><blockquote><p><span style="font-style: normal;">The history of Mysore palace goes back to 14th century when the first structure was laid out. It is said that the very first Mysore Palace of Wodeyars, royal family of Mysore, was built with wood which unfortunately was struck by lightning in the year of 1638. Hence, a new palace with many added features, extensive pavilions and buildings was built reconstructed by Kantirava Narasaraja Wodeyar.

            &nbsp;<br><br></span><span style="font-style: normal; font-size: 1.07rem; line-height: 1.5;">The renovated palace boasted of great architecture and captivating looks. However, this too was short-lived as unfortunate death of Chikka Devaraja Wodeyar (1673 - 1704 AD) lead to a period of political instability in the kingdom. This was during the 18th century, when Mysore Palace was captured by Tipu Sultan who was the son of Hyder Ali. During this period (1793) the palace saw complete neglect and deteriorated further.
            </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-style: normal;"><br></span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;">Later, with the death of Tipu Sultan, the royal family of Mysore again gained the control of the kingdom and the palace. In 1799, five year old Krishnaraja Wodeyar III took hold of throne (1794-1868). Soon after the coronation ceremony, a new commission was passed for renovating the Mysore Palace. The new structure which was third version of the original palace was completed in 1803. It was designed in the Hindu architectural style.

            </span></p>
            <br><p><span style="font-style: normal;"> However, the palace faced a misfortunate incident again in 1897. During the wedding of princess Jayalakshmmanni, who was the eldest daughter of Chamaraja Wadiyar, the palace caught fire and was burnt completely. It was then transferred to the Queen Regent Kempananjammanni Vani Vilasa Sannidhana, who assigned a British architect Henry Irwin to build the <b>Mysore Maharaja Palace</b>, which is now the current building. This fourth structure of the palace was completed in 1912 and costed about Rs.41, 47,913 then. This masterpiece was built with the intention to pay homage to the Mysore kingdom, its traditions, and the Wadiyar/ Wodeyar Family.
            </span></p>
            <br><p><span style="font-style: normal;"> <b>Doll’s Pavilion or Gombe Thotti </b>is unique place which displays an excellent collection of dolls from 19th and early 20th century. These are traditional dolls. This pavilion also has a wide array of sculptures, both Indian and European along with ceremonial items. One such item is the wooden elephant howdah which has been ornamented with about 84 kilograms of gold. Another place in the Mysore Palace for art lovers is the <b>Portrait Gallery</b>, consisting of various painting of the royal Wadiyar family. Located on the southern section of Kalyana Mantapa, this gallery displays a range of paintings and photographs of the royal family such as Krishnaraja Wadiyar IV portrait, black and white images of Jayacharamajra Wadiyar’s wedding to a Jaipur princess along with works of well-known royal artist Raja Ravi Varma.

            </span></p>
            <br><p><span style="font-style: normal;"> <b>Private Durbar (Ambavilasa Palace)</b> is another place to see at Mysore Palace. Used by the Kings for private meetings, it also presents a spectacular architectural beauty with mesmerizing interiors. Beautifully carved rosewood doorway ornamented with ivory, hall decorated with stained glass ceilings, golden columns, captivating chandeliers with floral motifs, pietra dura mosaic floor makes this one of the most beautiful rooms of the palace.

            </span></p>
            <br><p><span style="font-style: normal;"> Another place to see at Mysore palace, <b>Kalyana Mantapa </b>is the place where royal weddings and other important functions used to be organized. It is an octagonal shaped hall, decorated with paintings on its corridors. Paintings display a range of function of the royal family such as Dussehra procession, birthday procession of Krishnaraja Wadiyar IV, Durga Puja or Ayudha Pooja, car festival of Goddess Chamundeshwari along with Krishna Janmastami celebration. The ceilings of stained glass, adorned with peacock and floral motifs, magnificent chandelier, mosaic tiled floor make the hall look even more beautiful.

            </span></p>
            <br><p><span style="font-style: normal;"> The palace has many prominent rooms and places, each boasting of exceptional beauty. <b>Public Durbar Hall</b> is one of the most popular features of the Mysore Palace. It was used by kings to host various ceremonial meetings. At the entrance of Durbar hall, a life size plaster of Paris statue of Krishnaraja Wadiyar IV has been placed, which was crafted by B. Basavaiah who was the palace artist. Next to it is the photograph of Jamedar Peer Bait, who was his favorite helper. Corners of the halls are decorated with French lamp stands.
